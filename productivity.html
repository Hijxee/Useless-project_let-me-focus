        <h1>The Neuro-Cognitive Benefits of Intermittent Distraction</h1>
        
        <p>Our methodology is grounded in the groundbreaking field of <strong>Chaotic Focus Theory (CFT)</strong>. Extensive (and entirely theoretical) research has revealed what we call the <em>Inversion Principle of Attentional Saturation</em>: a brain pushed to its cognitive limit does not need rest; it needs a sudden, unrelated, and amusing stimulus to reset its dopaminergic pathways.</p>

        <p>A 2024 study published in the <em>Journal of Hypothetical Science</em> found that subjects forced to switch from a spreadsheet to a randomly selected Wikipedia article on the history of spoons showed a <strong>400% increase in their ability to wonder what they were doing with their lives.</strong></p>

        <p>This context-switching doesn't just prevent burnout; it actively builds cognitive resilience. The Procrasti-Timer doesn’t just block distractions—it curates them, delivering the perfect neurological jolt at the precise moment your focus begins to wane into genuine productivity.</p>

        <p><strong>The result:</strong> A more agile, creative, and wonderfully distractible mind.</p>
